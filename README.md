# n8n-nodes-searxng-search

This is an n8n community node for integrating with SearXNG. It allows you to perform web searches using SearXNG instances in your n8n workflows.

[SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) is a privacy-respecting, self-hosted metasearch engine that aggregates results from various search services and databases. Users are neither tracked nor profiled.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Prerequisites

- A running SearXNG instance with API access

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

```bash
pnpm i n8n-nodes-searxng-search
```

## Operations

### Search

The node supports performing web searches with the following features:

- **Query**: Enter your search terms
- **Categories**: Choose from preset search categories (General, Images, News, Videos, Files, IT, Maps, Music, Science, Social Media) and optionally add **Custom Categories** as comma-separated values for instance-specific categories.

### Additional Options

- **Language**: Filter results by any API-valid language value (for example `en`, `en-US`, `pt-BR`, `all`, or instance-specific locale codes)
- **Time Range**: Filter results by time (Day, Week, Month, Year, or Any Time)
- **Safe Search**: Set safety level (Off, Moderate, or Strict)
- **Page Number**: Specify which page of results to retrieve
- **Format**: Choose output format (JSON, CSV, HTML, or RSS)
- **Engines**: Comma-separated list of engines to use (for example: `google,duckduckgo`)
- **Enabled Plugins**: Comma-separated list of plugins to enable
- **Disabled Plugins**: Comma-separated list of plugins to disable
- **Theme**: Theme name to use for rendering (for example: `simple`)
- **Image Proxy**: Proxy image URLs through the SearXNG instance
- **Autocomplete**: Autocomplete backend to use (for example: `duckduckgo`)
- **Input normalization**: Comma-separated fields are trimmed and re-joined with commas before being sent to SearXNG, and empty values are ignored.

## Credentials

To use this node, you need to configure credentials for your SearXNG instance:

1. **API URL**: The URL of your SearXNG instance (e.g., `http://searxng:8080`)
2. **API Key**: Your SearXNG API key (if required by your instance)

## Example Usage

1. Add the SearXNG node to your workflow
2. Configure your SearXNG credentials
3. Set up your search parameters:
   ```json
   {
     "query": "your search terms",
     "categories": ["general"],
     "customCategories": "my-custom-category",
     "additionalFields": {
       "language": "en-US",
       "time_range": "month",
       "safesearch": "1",
       "engines": "google,duckduckgo",
       "enabled_plugins": "Hash_plugin",
       "disabled_plugins": "Tracker_URL_remover",
       "theme": "simple",
       "image_proxy": true,
       "autocomplete": "duckduckgo",
       "format": "json"
     }
   }
   ```

### Response behavior by format

- **JSON format**:
  - Returns parsed `results` plus `metadata` and `raw` payload.
  - `Return Single Response` only applies to JSON responses with available parsed results.
- **Non-JSON formats (CSV/HTML/RSS)**:
  - Returns the payload as `rawResponse` without assuming `results` are present.
  - Includes `metadata.format` so downstream nodes can branch on response format.

#### Non-JSON example response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "privacy search",
  "metadata": {
    "format": "csv"
  },
  "rawResponse": "title,url,content\n..."
}
```

## Compatibility
